# Dashboard for WinForms - How to Display Product Sales that are Greater than $20k

The example shows how to filter item source data by the aggregated *ProductSales* field and how to display total product sales that are greater than $20k.

## Example Structure

The following *SalesByProduct* calculated field determines the total product sales:

```
aggr(Sum([ProductSales]), [ProductName])
```

The created field is added to the Gridâ€™s hidden dimension section and the ```[SalesByProduct] > 20000.0m``` expression is set in a [dashboard item filter](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116537/common-features/data-shaping/filtering) to see the total product sales that are greater than $20k.
